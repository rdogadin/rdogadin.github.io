                                significantly enhancing content personalization for oncology professionals. Through the application 
                                of graph analytics, I have been instrumental in analyzing community structures, identifying key 
                                contributors and thereby fostering meaningful collaborations among scientists. My expertise in data 
                                storytelling and visualization has been pivotal in providing clear insights into user behavior, 
                                aiding business stakeholders and executive leadership in making informed decisions. I developed 
                                a robust data pipeline for event streaming, ensuring seamless synchronization of information between 
                                DynamoDB and ArangoDB. Additionally, my skills in writing and executing OpenSearch queries have 
                                been crucial in compiling data to provide users with access to trending and recently published
